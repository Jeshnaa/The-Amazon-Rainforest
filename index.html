        <h3 id="intro"> The Amazon Rainforest is the world's largest rainforest.
          The area of this rainforest is 5.5 million km<sup>2</sup>. 60% of the forest is in Brazil. The rainforest is a beautiful and very biodiverse place. It spreads out in 9
          countries- Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Colombia, French Guiana, Suriname, Guyana and Venezuela.

      <h3 id="impintro"> The Amazon Rainforest is vital to the Earth in many ways.
        Some of the importances are given below: </h3>
<div class = "col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-8 col-xs-12"><img id="img"

     <!--<div class = "col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-sm-4 col-xs-12">-->
      <h4 id="imp"> The Amazon plays a dominant role in the Earth's carbon and oxygen cycle.</h3>
        <h5 id="imp1"> The Amazon Rainforest produces approximately 6-9% of the Earth's oxygen according to
          latest researchs. The Amazon rainforest absorbs large amounts of carbon dioxide from the air and releases
          oxygen. The Amazon
          helps in regulating the world's carbon and oxygen cycle. 40,000 of the plant species in the amazon play a very 
        important role in regiulating the Earth's climate and sustaining the water cycle.</h5>
        <!--<div class = "col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-8 col-xs-12">-->

        <br>
        <h4 id="imp"> It is rich in many resources. Some examples are as follows:</h4>
        <h5 id="imp1"> a) It provides mineral resources such as copper, tin, nickel, bauxite, manganese, iron ore and
          gold <br>
          b)It gives us many natural medicines Wasai- good for kidney health, Lapacho- boosts immunity, Cordoncillo-
          stops bleeding to treat gallstones etc and
          many more. 90% of the human diseases are treatable with medicines derived from the forest. <br>
          c) Provides wood, which is also the reason for many people having jobs. People such as carpenters, loggers etc
          work around wood to earn money
        </h5>
        <img id="img"src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/71/8b/41/718b415a1f67f4d95b481049f8007304.jpg" >
        <h4 id="imp"> The rainforest is very biodiverse</h4>
        <h5 id="imp1"> The Amazon Rainforest is very biodiverse. About 10% of the world's species can be found in
          the Amazon rainforest. About 427 mammal species,1300 bird,378 reptile, 400 amphibian species and 10,000species of beetles
          have been found to live in this rainforest. 15% of all the bird and butterfly species live in the Amazon. 80,000 plant 
          species live in the rainforest. The rainforest is a major habitat and thousands of species live here. Approximately 50% of the world's plants and animals live here.    </h5>
          <img src="https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ProtectAmazonImage_SocialShare.png">
          <h4 id="imp"> It is home to many indigenous people.</h4>
          <h5 id="imp1"> The Amazon is not only home to thousands of plants and animals but it is home to humans as well.
            A total of 30 million people live in the out of which 1.5 million people are indigenous. Many people depend on the 
            Amazon for food, shelter etc. There are 385 indigenous groups that live here.  
          </h5>
      <h3 id="impconclusion"> The Amazon benefits us in many other ways but the ones given above are some of the main importances.</h3>

     <h1 id="dangerheading">DANGERS TO THE RAINFOREST</h1> 
      <h3 id="dangerintro">The Amazon Rainforest is danger. Humans are destroying it for their own good. There 
        are some natural causes as well.</h3>
        <h4 id="danger1"> The urban population of the world is cutting trees down in the Amazon Rainforest which is a major reason for the destruction of the forest. In the last 3 decades, 
          one fifth of the forest has been cut down. Some of the reasons for people cutting down the trees are: <br>
        a) For wood <br> 
      b) For cattle ranching <br>
    c) Soybean production <br>
  d)Land expansion etc.<br>
  e) Mining<br>
  <img id="dangerspic"src="https://www.baileyjavinscarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/logging-accident.jpg" > <img id="dangerspic"src="https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GP01OVM_PressMedia.jpg"><img id="dangerspic" src="https://intpolicydigest.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/6016499808516.jpg" > <br>
        </h4>
  <h4 id="danger2">Another cause is forest fire. 13,235 km<sup>2</sup> of the forest was destroyed due to fires between August 2020
  and July 2021. The forest fires are rapidly increasing. Global warming is a reason but human causes are a more prominent reason.
  Runaway agricultural fire is one of the reasons. Sometimes people intentionally burn the trees to clear land. 
  Some other causes are floods, hurricanes and parasites. If the destruction of the rainforest continues then the forest will start taking in more oxygen than it produces. 
  <br>

   <br>
   </h4>
  <h4 id="problems"> Deforestation of the Amazon Rainforest is destroying many living beings' habitats. Animals,insects and even humans are losing their homes.
 <br> Some of the things that could happen if the Amazon Rainforest is wiped out are:
<br> </h4>
<h4 id="problems1">
a) Nearly half of the world's animals,plants and microorganisms would be destroyed<br>
b)There would be a huge loss in medical possibilites.For example we would lose 70% of the plants that can treat cancer.<br>
c) More droughts and flooding<br> 
d)5-6 more greenhouse gases will be released which would increase the speed of global warming.This would threaten agriculture.
The air quality will become worse in many places.<br>
e) We would lose 80% of the variety of food we get. <br>
f) Many people will lose their homes<br>

      <h1 id="saveheading"> SAVING THE RAINFOREST </h1>
      <h3 id="save1">The Amazon Rainforest is in danger. Everyone can contribute to the cause and help save the beautiful Amazon Rainforest.
      </h3>

      <h4 id="save2">Some ways in which you can help save the Amazon Rainforest are: </h4>
      <h5 id="save3">Reduce your Paper and Wood consumption</h5>
      <img id="saveimg" src="https://landportal.org/sites/landportal.org/files/styles/220heightmax/public/FSC.jpg?itok=Q-RFJsJH">
      <h6 id="save4">Paper and wood are two things which are very important for life. Paper is used to make books, tissue papers, bags etc.
        Wood is used in things like furniture, construction, decorative items etc. We cannot stop the use of paper and wood, but we can certainly 
      stop wastage of these materials. 'REDUCE, REUSE AND RECYCLE'- this is the best way to save these resources. Using cloth napkins instead of tissues,
    Reusing eco-friendly bags made of materials such as jute or fiber, reuse wooden waste etc. Everyone should buy products that have the FSC label-The Forest Stewardship Council's logo. It means that the wood used in the product is from forest- based materials legally approved and reclaimed. There are 3 types of FSC logos- FSC 100%, FSC mixed and FSC recycled. 
    These are some ways to save in which you can reduce the consumption of these two priceless materials.
   </h6>

   <h5 id="save3"> Reduce your beef consumption</h5>
   <img id="saveimg" src="https://civileats.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/190903-amazon-fires-grazing-cattle-grassfed-beef-eating-less-meat-3.jpg">
   <h6 id="save4"> Reducing your beef consumption will help save the Amazon. According to a report, about 70%-80% of the deforestation in the Amazon is for clearing land for 
     cattle ranching. Reducing beef consumption will save a gigantic amount of land and water usage. It will also save biodiversity.
     Brazil is the world's largest beef exporter. Reducing its demand will help in saving the rainforest immensly.
   25% of the world's tropical land could diminish by the end of the century if dairy and meat consumption is not reduced.

    </h6>
   <h5 id="save3"> Reduce your use of fossil fuels and your impact on the planet </h5>
   <img id="saveimg" src="https://myenergi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/renewable-energy.jpg">
   <h6 id="save4">  By reducing your use fossil fuels, you will reduce your impact on Amazon and other natural areas as well. It will reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. 
     You can also start using renewable sources of energy such as solar energy, wind energy, hydroelectricity etc. Turn off electrical appliances when not using them, use public transport or 
    carpooling to go to places or ride a bicycle or walk to your destination. </h6>
    <h5 id="save3">Support Organizations that work towards protecting the rainforest. </h5>
    <img id="saveimg" src="https://des.savingtheamazon.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Logo_SavingTheAmazon-02.png">
    <h6 id="save4"> There are many organizations that work to save the rainforest. Supporting them is a very effective way of protecting the rainforest. There are many organizations such as Amazon watch,
      Rainforest action Network etc. Some of these organisations not only help protect the rainforest but also fight for rights of indigenous people.
      If these organisations get the maximum support possible, they will be able to be more efficient. 
<h5 id="save2"> The Brazilian government is trying to stop illegal activity in the amazon rainforest by deploying military in the amazon, putting periodic bans on fires etc. The environmental minister has announced that illegal logging will end completely 
  by 2028 in Brazil. But according to many people, these efforts are not enough. Many people feel that the government should do more to protect the forest.
  Some ways the Brazil  government can be more efficient are by increasing funds for the environment protection organizations, increasing the amount of renewable energy used, making a more green environment, putting a law stating the maximum amount land per cattle rancher, 
  spreading awareness, supporting small scale forest-protection campaigns etc.
